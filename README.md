## Assigned: Wednesday, March 30, 2022
## Due: Wednesday, April 6, 2022

After cloning this repository to your computer, please take the following steps:

- Follow the instructions on the Proactive Programmers web site for this project
- Use the `cd` command to change into the directory for this repository
- Change into the program directory by typing `cd fibonaccicreator`
- Install the dependencies for the project by typing `poetry install`
- Run the program with one of the algorithms by typing:
  - `poetry run fibonaccicreator --number 10000 --approach iterativetuple`
  - Please note that this is not the only configuration you should try for your experiment
  - Please note that the program will not work unless you add the required source code
  - Please refer to the `writing/reflection.md` file for all ways to run the program
- Confirm that the program is producing the expected output
- Please bear in mind that your program will produce different output than what is
  evident on the course web site since each laptop will have different performance characteristics
- Use a `docker run` command for your operating system to run GatorGrader
- Please be aware that performance profiling in a Docker contain may not work as expected
- Provide all of the required responses in the `writing/reflection.md` file
